This version has bin close on the right.


```{r loadPackages, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(binr)
```


This version has bins open on the right

```{r tryRightFalse}
my_df <- tibble(t = 835:1017)
my_df %>% 
  mutate(bin = cut(t, seq(min(t), max(t) + 4, 4), right = FALSE))
```

Bins closed on the right

```{r tryRightTrue}
my_df <- tibble(t = 835:1017)
my_df %>% 
  mutate(bin = cut(t, seq(min(t), max(t) + 4, 4), right = TRUE))
```
