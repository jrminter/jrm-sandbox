## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r diamondPlot}
library(ggplot2)
# fig_path('.pdf', options = list(fig.path='./figure/abc-', label='first-summary'))
plt <- ggplot(diamonds) +
       geom_point(aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) +
       geom_smooth(aes(x=carat, y=price)) +
       NULL
plt
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
